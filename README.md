# Sassy Timantha

An exercize to practice Sass.

## Tasks

1. Modularize the `styles.scss` file into many other files so that the only code in `styles.scss` is importing the other files.
1. Find all colors used and create a variable to store each. Replace all color literals with a variable.
1. Apply nesting to the styles where it makes sense

You can use [Scout-App](https://Scout-App.io) to process the Sass.


## Bonus points

If you have [Node](https://nodejs.org) (and npm) installed, try making the linter pass:

1. `npm install`
1. `npm run sasslint`
